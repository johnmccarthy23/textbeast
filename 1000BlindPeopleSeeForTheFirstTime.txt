- In this video,
we're curing 1,000 people's blindness.
(crowd cheering)
It's gonna be crazy.
- [Narrator 1] Most of us see the world like this.
But here's the thing,
200 million people see the world like this.
- [Mr. Beast] But I just made it one less.
- Oh.
Wow.
- [Narrator 1] She is just one
of 1000 blind people we helped
from around the world.
- They can't see.
But we have all the technology to fix it.
- Yep, half of all the blindness in the world
is people who need a 10-minute surgery.
- Crazy. - Yeah.
- Oh my God.
I see everybody.
- Oh, I can see clearer. (laughs)
I can jump for joy! (laughs)
- Yeah, I can see your face,
I can see your face,
I can see your face.
- [Mr. Beast] If you're wondering
how the surgery allows people to see again,
it's because the lens in their eyes is so cloudy
that they can't see through it.
So the surgeon uses a tiny vacuum
to suck up the clouded lens.
- Whoa, it's sucking.
- [Mr. Beast] And replace it with an artificial one.
- [Narrator 2] The surgery is that simple.
They can see again.
- Woo...
Oh my...
- You pay for my surgery?
- Yes.
- Seriously?
- You know what?
Here's $10,000.
To make your day even better. (person in mask screaming)
Is she okay?
We're gonna go fix more people's eyesight.
She's squeezing hard.
- [Narrator 1] And we're just getting started.
We still have 980 lives left to change.
- Sheesh! There's my watch.
I've never seen it before.
- Oh my God.
- I have night blindness,
I couldn't see.
And you just deal with it for life.
- I'm Nolan, by the way.
- I'm Karl.
- You're Karl?
I know a guy named Karl.
Not a good guy.
- [Mr. Beast] Moment of truth.
- Wow, you are pretty ain't you?
(Mr. Beast chuckling)
- What's it like?
What do you see?
- Blur.
- How long have you not been able to work for?
- Four months?
- Did you hear about the cross eyed teacher?
She couldn't control her pupils.
- Ugh...
- I'm gonna need an anesthetic soon.
(dramatic upbeat music)
- Oh man.
No cloudiness, no blurriness.
- Oh, it's perfect.
- [Mr. Beast] Now what's it like?
- I can see everything.
- I don't need these. (laughs)
- Our next patient is Charlie.
You're not able to read any of this text on the TV?
- Nope, it's an E or something I think.
- He won't know he won 10 grand
until after his surgery.
I can't wait to see his reaction.
Charlie sees everything like this,
and it's made him and his family's life extremely difficult.
- I was a cashier
and my eyes was getting so bad,
I couldn't see how much money to give back.
I just wanna get my vision back
so I can go back to work.
- Man, you're gonna be really happy after this surgery.
- We'll see after it.
- Trust me, you will see.
- [Mr. Beast] When patients go into surgery,
there's a chance that they can get their life back.
And for Charlie,
if the surgery goes well,
he can go back to work.
What's it like?
- Oh, wow.
- All right, let's see if he can read it now.
What does this say?
- You just won $10,000.
- Here you go.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh my gosh. - Oh.
- [Charlie] It feels good.
I didn't think I was ever gonna be able to see again.
- Thank you all so much.
- I don't wanna lose none of it.
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh no, I'll hold on to it. (everyone laughing)
- Dr. Nolan.
- He's not really a doctor.
He's a fool.
- Do you need any help?
(medical staff laughing) (upbeat music continues)
- Wow.
- And I just haven't been me for the last 62 years.
I can actually see your face.
- That's crazy.
- I can read this.
(Mr. Beast laughing)
- When you come out of the surgery,
what's the first thing that you are excited to see?
- My son.
He's been my rock through all of this.
- Before the operation,
you mentioned the first thing you wanted to see
was your son.
- Seeing him,
seeing his face.
That's what I miss you know.
- You're gonna make me cry.
- No, no.
You're good, man.
You're good.
You're really good, man.
- [Mr. Beast] All right.
- Oh my God, man.
- There you go.
- Hey, Dad.
Don't cry.
- I can see everybody's facial features now.
Just a little blurry with my tears coming out.
(everyone chuckling)
- How's it going?
- Okay. (chuckles)
Yeah, I've been subscribed to you for like 11 years.
- Really? Oh my gosh.
- Jeremiah has been blind in his right eye
since he was born.
And it's affected his vision his entire life.
Are you excited to be able to see out of both?
- Hopefully, if the surgery goes that way.
- [Narrator 1] Because Jeremiah was born with cataracts,
his right eye has never received light.
Which means this surgery only has a 50% chance of working.
- I think we go ahead
and get it underway,
and then we'll just talk post-op.
- [Narrator 1] And while Jeremiah's surgery was underway,
I met another young man named, Satchel.
- Did they tell you I was gonna be here?
- No. - Good.
He had poor vision from birth,
and almost lost his entire vision
after a go-karting accident.
- All I see is like blur and color.
I can barely see the shapes.
- Obviously, you can't drive, right?
- No, I cannot.
- And this is the real reason why we're doing this.
Blindness can take away parts of your life.
- And you know, I wanna drive.
Since I can't drive,
I'm just at home.
- Good luck.
We'll see you after the procedure.
He mentioned multiple times,
he really wants to drive
after this procedure fixes his eyesight.
So I'll see you at the end of the video
when we surprise him with a brand new Tesla.
- [Narrator 1] But first,
let's see if Jeremiah's surgery was successful.
- Let's do this.
How'd it go?
- Good. - Yeah?
Are you excited?
- (laughs) Yeah. (gentle uplifting music)
- Take your time.
No pressure.
- Everything looks so more clear.
- Yeah?
To make this day even more special,
since you're about to graduate high school
and go to college,
we wanted to give you $50,000 to put towards college.
(gentle uplifting music continues)
- I didn't even think this was real.
Like I'm waiting to wake up.
Oh my god.
- [Narrator 2] And now,
let's check in to see how Satchel's surgery went.
- Now I don't even see any blur.
It's kind of great.
- How are you feeling?
How's life been now?
- It's been good, you know.
I'll be like looking at the cars
and I'm like, "Wow, I can see that car
"all the way over there."
- That's good.
If you're gonna drive.
- Yeah. (everyone laughing)
- I have a surprise for you.
Do you mind putting on this blindfold?
- Hold on, hold on.
- I know it's a little ironic
that we just did the surgery.
Satchel, take off your blindfold.
(car horn beeping)
- What? (upbeat music)
- This is your brand new Tesla.
- Woo!
- And if Chris wrecks it,
I'll buy another one.
- Oh! (chuckles)
Literally, I cannot put into words
how I feel right now.
- Have you ever driven a car before?
- No. (upbeat music continues)
- I love how we're letting a guy
who couldn't see a couple weeks ago drive us.
- Yeah. - Wait.
There's one cone you should hit.
- Don't hit the cone.
(upbeat music continues)
- Yeah! (everyone applauding)
(car horn beeping)
- So not only are we helping people here in America
but we're also going to other places around the world.
- [Narrator 1] Because unfortunately,
nearly half the population with curable blindness
doesn't have access to this surgery.
- [Narrator 2] So I wanted to provide this
for as many people as possible.
(uplifting orchestral music)
- You see how many?
- Two.
- I can see!
- As a thank you
because you were just so gracious in this video,
we wanna make a $100,000 donation.
- It'll bring sight to thousands of people.
(speaking in foreign language)
- I see everything.
- Oh my god, you are so beautiful.
(Nolan laughing)
Wow!
- Thank you, Mr. Beast.
- Thank you.
- [Everyone] Thank you!
(uplifting orchestral music fades)
